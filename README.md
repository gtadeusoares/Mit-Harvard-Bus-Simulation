# Mit-Harvard-Bus-Simulation
## Description of the project: 
This project simulates the bus stops from MIT to Harvard. In addition to making the 
marker move, I added:

(1) The options for it to stop moving 

(2) A button to move to the next stop 

(3) A button to move to the previous stop

## How to run:
1- Press the first button to begin the simulation.

2- Press stop to stop the simulation.

3- Press next to move the marker to the next stop.

4- Press previous to move the marker to the previous stop.

5- Do not press the previous button before pressing next at least once. 

## Roadmap of future improvements:
I plan to connect to the MBTA server and track the buses in real-time.
